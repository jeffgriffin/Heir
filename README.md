# Heir to the Pwn
This addon was written out of a desire to introduce my young heir to questing and the narrative of the Warcraft universe, while still moderating player content (chat and player/pet/guild names).

## Please note
This is not a babysitter or a replacement for Blizzard's language filter or parental controls.  In order to perform its function, this addon assumes a parent player is moderating the name and player lists, and the child player is not actively attempting to circumvent it (by turning off the addon, etc.).  This addon may not sufficiently sanitize the player experience to your personal parental level of acceptance, so you are encouraged to evaluate it thoroughly before using it to play the game with your child.

## Features
* Name List - Allows a parent to curate a list of appropriate player, pet and guild names by right clicking on the unit frame or using the 'wlname' command.  Names in this list are broadcast to the child, allowing him or her to see the name on unit frames, tooltips and name plates.  If a name is not whitelisted, it will be hidden or replaced.

* Player List - A name-realm list.  This works much like the name list above, but governs messages in chat and party invites.

* Friend List/Guild List/BattleNet - These lists will be treated as automatically whitelisted, just make sure you know who is on them, and It will help to add yourself! 

* Static Settings - As a convenience, the following options are automatically set, and prevented from changing: Profanity Filter On,Spam Filter On, Block Channel Invites True, Show Battle Net Friend Request Off, Chat Bubbles Off.

* Functional Settings - Additionally, the folloiwing settings are required in order for the addon to be able to do its job: Show Friendly Player Names Off, Show Friendly Minion Names Off, Show Enemy Player Names Off, Show Enemy Minion Names Off, Show Friendly Nameplates On, Show Friendly Minion Nameplates On, Show Enemy Nameplates On, Show Enemy Minion Nameplates On.  One caveat to the above is if your child would like to see player nameplates, you can turn on Always Show Nameplates.  In which case, Show Friendly Player Names, Show Friendly Minion Names, Show Enemy Player Names, and Show Enemy Minion Names, can be toggled back on.

## Getting Started

2. Execute the slash command "/heir enroll \<parent character name\>" on the child's character.  You won't have to do this again for this character pairing.
